# Password Generator

## Description

This webpage was created as part of a UT Full Stack Flex Coding Bootcamp challenge. I modified starter code to create a simple password generator. This password generator creates a random password 8-128 characters in length. Users can choose the length of the password as well as which characters to include through a series of prompts and confirmations. Character options include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

## Usage

The user is prompted to choose a password length 8-128 characters in length. The user is directed to try again if the length chosen is below 8 characters or above 128 characters. Once an appropriate length is chosen, the user will be asked to confirm which characters should be included. Character options include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The user will be prompted to try again if no character types are chosen. The new random password will be generated on the page after the last confirmation.
